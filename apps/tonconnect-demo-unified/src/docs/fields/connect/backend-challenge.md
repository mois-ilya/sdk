## Purpose

Challenge is random bytes generated by your backend. Wallet signs this challenge
to prove ownership. Backend verifies the signature later.

## Why it matters

- **Proves ownership** — Only private key holder can sign
- **Prevents replay** — Each challenge is unique
- **Time-bounded** — Challenge expires (typically 15 min)

## Implementation

This demo uses JWT to create stateless challenges:
- Backend signs random bytes into JWT
- SHA256 hash of JWT sent to wallet as payload
- On verification: JWT signature proves challenge authenticity

## Alternatives

- Database-stored nonces with expiration
- Redis cache with TTL
- Session-based storage
